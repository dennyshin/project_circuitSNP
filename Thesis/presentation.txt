circuitSNP: analysis of genetic variants on chromatin accessibility

eQTL
	- the gene expression level affects the phenotype
chromatin accessibility
	- TF binding initiates gene expression
	- TF binding is dependent on chromatin accessibility
	- non-coding variants affect binding behaviour of TFs (centiSNP)
	- EMPHASIS: NOT A BINARY OPEN/CLOSE BEHAVIOUR (although we define it as such later)
		- "open" is 20 time effect difference caused by SNP

can we model the accessibility of chromatin using TF motif footprints?
	- without the need of expression data
	- our attempt is to use NN
	- i will explain in more detail later but the summary is we input a vector and recieve a probability vector of an answer

overview diagram
	- do not go into explaining details
	- use it as a reference to go back to

motif footprints: CENTIPEDE
	- these footprints become the training instances for our model
	- how its made
	- X = motif footprint (binding / no binding)
	- Y = tissue specific chromatin accessibility ("open" / "closed")
	
overview diagram progress

variant instances: centiSNP
	- How we create new variant effect instances
	- where we are on overall diagram
	
verification of predictions
	- use dsQTL data
	
more detail???
	
Results
	- model selection
	- variant instances are sparse
	- dsQTL verification results are inconclusive
		- need to revisit our generation of variant instances
		- are we training the wrong pattern?
		- better regions
			- will improve represenation of variant instances
			
Summary

Concluding Remarks
