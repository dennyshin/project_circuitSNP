Project circuitSNP was made as part of an ongoing research project. While the product is not fully ready to be used as a python package, the scripts and functions are still able to be used in the userâ€™s research contexts and goals.

### dataprep.py

This script's main function is to generate the training instances and also split the dataset into three parts: train set, validation set, test set. By default each set contains 70%, 20% and 10% of the original dataset respectively.
